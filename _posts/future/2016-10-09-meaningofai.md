This article highlights the potential benefits of AI. The covered themes are:

- scientific development
- potential risks for the human race and ai as a solution
- obstacles regarding computing power

### Scientific development

### Potential risks

### Limits

This chapter should contain:

* computing power
* end of Moor's law?
* possible solution for enhance the power of computers
