      <h2>About the Site</h2>
      <p>
	    Machine learning is one of the fastest improving area of science. This site gathers and puts into context a lot of 
		information about Ai included: ethical questions, philosophycal questions. The main focus is on machine learning and
		especially on algorithms. 
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    The tab ML contains articles. The main topics I am interested in: how to improve reinforcement learning algorithms, find a connection
		between chaos theory and reinforcement learning to make better predictions, deep neural networks to apply them in reinforcement learning,
		image processing algorithms and the impacts of artificial intelligence on humanity.
