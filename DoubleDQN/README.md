[![dqn](https://img.youtube.com/vi/yiKu66FOX6I/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiKu66FOX6I)

This is an implementation of the Double DQN algorithm. Apart from some smaller differences the implementation is in line with the following two article:

[Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.htm)
[Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf).

The outline of this overview is:
* Brief description of the whole algorithm
* Requirements for using the current algoithm
* Results, conclusions
