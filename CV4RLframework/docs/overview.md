### cv4sensorhub

[cv4sensorhub](http://bmeaut.github.io/cv4sensorhub/) is an environment for interdisciplinary image processing tasks. The CV4RLframework connects to a special image processing problem, namely to live-polylines. 

### A special tool live-polyline

![LivePolyline example](images/LivePolygonElesben.png)

In this picture the background is a marble thin section image. The goal of the image processing in this case is to find the exact boundaries of the grains. This is important for experts to draw conclusions like the provenance of the sample etc. Traditionally the segmenting process is done manually but cv4sensorhub provides algorithms to this on a semi-automatic way. A part of this process to correct the wrong segmenting curves at the end or do the whole segmentation manually in case of difficult images. 

Live-polyline is a special drawing tool to help this. The only thing the user should do is to click somewhere in the border of a grain then move the mouse to another point of the border. The live-polyline algorithm will propose a curve which connects these two points by folowing the border of the grain. After a new click the recommended curve is finalized. With this tool the user does not have to draw the segmenting curves entirely but clicking on right places and the remaining work is done by the algorithm. 

### Structure of the RL framework

The recommendation process uses reinforcement learning to develop better recommendation strategies. This documentation shows the structure of the framework but not algorithm.
