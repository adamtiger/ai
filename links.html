	  <p> One of the leading laboratory in reinfocement learning is <a href="https://deepmind.com/">Google DeepMind.</a> 
	  They were the creators of the  famous algorithm AlphaGo which won the game Go against Lee Sedol in March 2016. </p>
	  <p> <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI gym</a> is a benchmarking toolkit for reinforcement learning algorithms. You can develop your RL algorithm 
	  in Python then upload it to the website to compare its performance with other algorithms. </p>
	   <p> These <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0">lectures</a> are held by David Silver, a talented RL researcher. His course is one of the
