      <p>Some useful links are listed here with a short descriptions. The links point to courses, books, news, laboratories etc.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p> There was an overarching conference in Asilomar on artificial intelligence.  Further details on <a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/">this site.</a> </p>
	  <p> One of the leading laboratory in reinfocement learning is <a href="https://deepmind.com/">Google DeepMind.</a> 
	  They were the creators of the  famous algorithm AlphaGo which won the game Go against Lee Sedol in March 2016. </p>
	  <p> This is the <a href="https://mila.umontreal.ca/en/">site</a> of Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms.</p>
	  <p> <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI gym</a> is a benchmarking toolkit for reinforcement learning algorithms. You can develop your RL algorithm 
	  in Python then upload it to the website to compare its performance with other algorithms. </p>
	   <p> These <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0">lectures</a> are held by David Silver, a talented RL researcher. His course is one of the
	   best available RL materials to getting started.</p>
