Hi! I am a PhD student at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. I am enthusiastic about the applications of machine learning because it can solve more and more tasks which were tractable only by humans so far. In machine learning my favourite learning framework is the reinforecement learning (RL). In RL, the algorithms learns from interacting with the environment instead of a passive observation which makes it more human-like. 

Data Science is an umbrella name for the sciences which deal with extracting information from raw data. Nowadays more and more data is gathered about people, processes and nature due to the ubiquitous IoT equipments. With machine learning the models to predict changes become more and more accurate. Finding patterns in the data can be also supported by machine learning models. I like to learn more about these methods and apply them in real data.
