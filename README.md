# Examples for ml algorithms

## DoubleDQN

In this project the break-through result on using machine learning to play Atari2600's games is reproduced. The following two article is taken account:

[Human-level control through deep reinforcment learning](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html)
[Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)

In this case three games are examined: Breakout, Freeway and Riverraid. The environment is given by OpenAi gym, the neural network was built with Keras. The project is in-progress.

## MountainCar

In this project the classical control problem Mountain Car was examined and solved in C++. There is no third party library in the project. The applied reinforcement learning algorithm was: Sarsa with coarse coding. 

## NArmedBandit

The classical N armed bandit was solved with a TD like algorithm. The solution was tested in both stationary and non-stationary environments.

## Q-learning

In this project the Q-learning algorithm was tested in the classical Windy Gridworld.

## WindyGridWorld

In this project the several algorithms (Sarsa, Q, Q_lambda, Sarsa_lambda) were tested in the classical Windy Gridworld.
